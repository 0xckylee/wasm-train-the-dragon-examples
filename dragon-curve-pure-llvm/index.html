<!-- We use the standard fetch API to load our module, 
    and the built-in WebAssembly JavaScript API to instantiate it.
    WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming returns a promise that resolves with a module object, containing an instance of our module. 
    Our C functions are now available as the instance’s exports, and we can use them from JavaScript however we please. 

     a memory object representing the linear memory of our WebAssembly module can contain important things like our stack of instructions for the virtual machine.
     __heap_base property gives us an offset into a memory region that is safe for us to use (the heap).
     We give the offset into the “good” memory to our dragonCurve function, call it, and extract the contents of the heap populated with coordinates as a Float64Array.
     The rest is just drawing a line on the canvas based on the coordinates extracted from our Wasm module. 

     Run this to see it:
     docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) -p 8000:8000 zloymult/wasm-build-kit \
     python -m http.server

     Navigate to http://localhost:8000 and behold the dragon curve!
