## Getting started with wasm

[First step (webassembly site)](https://webassembly.org/)

[MDN has a lot of great material about wasm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)

[WebAssembly on github](https://github.com/WebAssembly)

## Don't be afraid of specs. Wasm has several

[WebAssemblyCore](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/index.html)

[WebAssembly JS Embeddings](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/js-api/index.html)

## Wasm has a textual representation

[You can read about it here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format)

[And play with it here](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/)

## C/C++ to wasm

[Emscrpten](https://emscripten.org/)

## Rust to wasm

[wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack)

[And the whole book about it](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/)
